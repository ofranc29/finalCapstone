                                    BJJ was brought to Brazil in the early 1900's by Mitsuyo Maeda. He taught the art to
                                    the founding brothers of the Brazilian strain of the martial art, Helio and Carlos.
                                    Helio was a very small and feable man, with some health issues. He found it
                                    difficult to execute some of the techniques taught by Maeda and so he took his time
                                    to refine the movement to make them more feasible for himself. Thus came the birth
                                    of BJJ.
